# Accept three integers representing the angles of a triangle in degrees to determine whether they form a valid set of angles of a triangle. If it is not a valid set, then generate a message and terminate the process. If it is a valid set, then the process determines whether it is equiangular (all three angles are the same). It also determines if the triangle is right-angled (has one angle with 90 degrees), obtuse-angled (one angle above 90), or acute-angled (all three angles are below 90 degrees). Finally, it shows the conclusion about the triangle.
